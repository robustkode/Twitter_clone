# [Water Bottle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/water-bottle-dataset)

## Overview
This dataset contains a collection of images of water bottles with varying water levels. The images are divided into three categories: Full water level, Half water level, and Overflowing. Each category contains a number of images of water bottles with the corresponding water level.

The purpose of the dataset is to be used for an image classification problem, where a machine learning model is trained to classify the water level of a given water bottle image. The dataset is intended to be used for training and testing a machine learning model for image classification.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of a number of water bottle images, each of which has been classified based on the water level inside the bottle. The images in the Full water level category show water bottles with the maximum possible amount of water inside, while the images in the Half water level category show water bottles with roughly half the maximum amount of water inside. The images in the Overflowing category show water bottles with more water inside than the maximum capacity of the bottle, resulting in water spilling out.
